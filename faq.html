          What is colorism?
        </div>
        </br>
        <p>
          Colorism plays a role in the treatment of people all around the world. It is the concept that light-skinned people are treated with a higher regard than their darker-skinned companions.

        <p>
          This idea dates back to slavery, when lighter skinned slaves were treated better than those with darker skin. Lighter-skinned slaves were "house slaves" and they were treated with better living and working conditions. The darker skinned, or "field" slaves had the worst living and working conditions, and were punished more severely.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          This created the idea that lighter skin was better skin, thus the principle of colorism. Colorism divided the black community through practices like the paper bag test and the blue vein test. In the blue vein test, you were deemed worthy if your skin was light enough to see the blue veins underneath. If you were the color of a paper bag or lighter, you passed the paper bag test.

          What is AI bias?
        </div>
        </br>
        <p>
          Now, bias in artificial intelligence (we will refer to it as AI bias), typically results from unintentional bias on the part of a programmer. They often do not consider types of people who are different than themselves when they are creating a product.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          For example, facial recognition software often has a harder time picking up faces with darker skin tones. This is probably because there was a lack of colored people in the images that were used to teach the software what a face is. This is a problem because products that are supposed to make life easy and fun are not working well for a good percentage of the population.
