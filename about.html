          <p>I’m <em>Kyra Parris</em>, I’m sixteen years old, and I am a rising junior at Cushing Academy, a boarding school in Ashburnham, Massachusetts. I have always been interested in technology and coding, but it was not until I joined Girls Who Code that i began to think of programming as a possible career option. I am very involved with social justice work at my school, especially when the topic of colorism comes up. It only made sense for me to combine two of my interests into this one final project. </p>

          <p>My name is <em>Venessa Okoroanyanwu</em>. I am fifteen and I am a rising junior at the Canterbury School in New Milford, CT. I did Girls Who Code this summer because I wanted to learn more about the behind the scenes of technology. I became interested in the topic of colorism in relation to technology after watching a video made by Joy Buolamwini, and that interest lead to the making of this website.</p>

          <p>I’m <em>Jennah Shabazz</em>, I’m seventeen, I attend Science Park High School and am a rising senior. I decided to do Girls Who Code because when my my approached me with the idea of it I wasn’t into at first but when she started to explain what they do and why they do it I thought that it would be cool to be involved so i sent in my application. I decided to join the project about colorism because it’s a big issue in america but not too many people notice it or if they do they ignore it and hope it fixes itself.</p>

          <p>My name is <em>Brianna Rodriguez</em>, I’m seventeen and I am a rising junior at Donald Payne School of Technology. I decided to do Girls Who Code because I’ve wanted to pursue a career in technology since eighth grade and I really enjoy the feeling of sisterhood with young girls. Colorism is a topic that isn’t discussed often when it should be, especially in the Technology industry today. So if I can combine my passions for coding and equal rights to change that, why not! Someone has to speak up if we want this to change and i’m proud to be doing this with these amazing ladies.</p>
